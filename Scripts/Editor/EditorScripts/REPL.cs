    This is a tool to give you a Read Eval Print Loop in Unity, based on Miguel De Icaza's tool. 
    What is a REPL? See the Wikipedia article. 
    Caveats: At present there's no edit history, neither variables nor output history survive assembly reloads, output formatting is weak and not all output sources are captured gracefully and -- well, there's quite a lot of caveats but the tool is entirely usable and useful! 
     
    
    
    The Code Import this package into your project and go to Window -> REPL -> Shell. 
    Media:REPL_20100308.zip 
    Or grab the repo from GitHub.
