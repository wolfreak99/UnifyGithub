DescriptionCustom inputmanager that allows you to change inputs from keyboard,mouse and joystick (including axes) on the fly. Unity's default inputmanager only allows you to change the inputs at start. 
Usage Go to the link and download the custom inputmanager. Extract the rar file with Winrar or a simular tool. This will extract a unity project folder that you can open in unity. 
You can start using the script right away if you please or you can test the example scene first. The script is well commented and should be selfexplaining. 
If you would still have problems/questions mail me at ward.dewaele@pandora.be 
EDIT: as on version 1.4 everything goes a lot smoother now. 
Import the inputmanager controller, and add a few lines of code to your script and it's working ! 
Link Unity Custom InputManager 1.4 
Version 2.x can be found on the Unity Asset Store or at the cInput2 website
